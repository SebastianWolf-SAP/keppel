# v1.0.0 (TBD)

Initial release.

Keppel is being used productively at SAP Converged Cloud, but I have not made
releases yet: We use Continuous Delivery internally, so releases don't matter.
If you want to use Keppel elsewhere and want to have discrete releases, let me
know via GitHub issue and I'll start cutting releases.
